# Groupie Tracker Filters

Groupie Tracker Filters is a project that allows users to filter and refine the list of artists or bands displayed on the platform. By providing multiple filtering options, users can find artists and bands that meet specific criteria, enhancing the browsing experience and personalizing search results.

## Features

The project includes four main filters:

- Filter by Creation Date - Find artists or bands based on the year they were formed.

- Filter by First Album Date - Search for artists or bands by the release date of their debut album.

- Filter by Number of Members - Display artists or bands with a specified range of members.

- Filter by Locations of Concerts - Discover artists or bands by selecting concert locations.

## Filter Types

To offer a flexible filtering experience, the project incorporates two types of filters:

- Range Filter: Filters results between two specified values (e.g., creation year from 1970 to 1980).

- Checkbox Filter: Filters results based on one or the number of members(e.g., a band with two members checkbox 2).

## Usage

- Select Filters - Choose the criteria you'd like to apply from the filter options.

- Apply Filters - Refine the displayed artists and bands based on the selected filters.

- Reset Filters - Clear any applied filters to return to the default display.
